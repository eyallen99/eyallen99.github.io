                         <p>As an author, I am happy to visit schools and events to talk about building peace in ourselves, our homes, schools, community, and the world! We don’t only learn about other peacemakers, but about our own power to act as peacemakers.

Please contact me if you would like to discuss the possibility of such a visit to your school or event.</p>
