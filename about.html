                         <p>Peace, Love, Action! is an illustrated, illuminated A-Z of everyday actions that directly make a peaceful, fun, and vibrant world. With original artworks bringing each action to life, “make friends,” “go local,” “cooperate,” “forgive”—seemingly small deeds can really add up! Illustrated by Tanya Zabinski in her characteristic earthy style, each action comes with an inspirational mini-bio of a real hero who exemplifies that action, from Thich Nhat Hanh (“breathe”) to Wangari Maathai (“plant”), and follows with a set of “What You Can Do” prompts. With a foreword by singer-songwriter and activist legend, Ani DiFranco.</p>
